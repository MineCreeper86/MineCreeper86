### 又是一位大佬光临我的主页呢！
# `this.getBriefInfo()` -->
  这里是``MineCreeper86``，普通的初三技术宅，有强烈的为小⑤的知名项目做出贡献~~其实说白了就是女装~~的冲动，喜欢数学~~但不怎么喜欢几何~~的男孩子，在技术上毫无建树，梦想院校是清华。近期致力于推广理解性学习。有常年不更新的[博客](https://minecreeper.top/)一个，写了些文笔很烂的议论文，还有些我自己的学习思考，希望各位大佬莅临参观。

This is ``MineCreeper86``, a common Junior 3 male geek, have intense impulse to contribute on the famous repo of Satori-Komeiji ~~In fact, dressing up like women~~, like Maths ~~Not geometry~~, no remarkable advancement on technology, dream school is Tsinghua. Focusing on making people better understand their knowledge recently. Have a not-regularly-updated [blog](https://minecreeper.evanluo.top/) and've written some bad articles and thought of study, hope you'll visit.

  二年级在父亲引导下体验了``Visual Basic``但英语水平受限没有深入；从五年级开始正式接触``Java``，暂时没有系统性地参与过课程；五年级首次接触Microbit单片机，初一购入Arduino并因此学习``C``；初二开始因为项目需要尝试了``Python``，``JavaScript``但功底极差。
  
 When I was in Grade 2, I tried ``Visual Basic`` in order to follow father's guide, but paused by limited English skill. Started coding in ``Java`` in Grade 5, temporarily haven't taken lessons. Used Microbit in Grade 5 and Arduino in Junior 2, because of Arduino, I studied ``C``. In Junior 3, tried ``Python`` and ``JavaScript`` due to projects but can hardly code.
 
 ### 熟练程度 Familiarity
 
 ``Java`` >> ``Python`` = ``C`` > ``JavaScript`` > ``Visual Basic``

  在你站虽然也码了不少代码，但Star不多（毕竟全是一时兴起的半成品很正常），勉强能用的大概也就这几个，语言类型和方面都超级广（（
  
  Although I've coded a lot, but there aren't so many stars (It's quite normal since my works are almost all semi-finished products). These several ones may be the only ones can be barely used and covers a huge range of language types and aspects.
